A no-fuss [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) forms component that just works.

  - **Plug'n'Play**. Input elements in, values out.
  - Works just like a normal form. Except it does all the tedious work for you.
  - **Extendable**. Work with most inputs and custom input components out of the box. No more fussing around with custom components and passing data back-and-forth between components.
  - ~~**A toolbox of actions** to apply to your elements: **Validate**, **FocusOnSelect**, **Numbers**, **TextareaAutoRezie**, and many more.~~ (Soon!)

[**Try it out on the Svelte REPL!**](https://www.google.com)

## Usage

The package emits an `update` event that contains an object with all the values of your input elements.

Using built-in HTML input elements:
```html
<script>
  import Form from "@svelteschool/svelte-forms";
  let formValues;
</script>

<Form on:update={({ detail }) => (formValues = detail)}>
  <input
    placeholder="Enter first name..."
    type="text"
    name="firstName" />
  <input
    placeholder="Enter last name..."
    type="text"
    name="lastName" />
</Form>
```

The `update` event emits an object containing your values. In the above example it would look something like this:

```js
{
  firstName: 'Svelte',
  lastName: 'School
}
```

Inputs that do not have a `name` property or are `disabled` will not show up in the object.

__File inputs are not supported.__
